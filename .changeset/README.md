# Changesets

Hello and welcome! This folder has been automatically generated by `@changesets/cli`, a build tool that works
with multi-package repos, or single-package repos to help you version and publish your code. You can
find the full documentation for it [in the readme](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/blob/main/README.md)

## Usage

### Adding a changeset

Run `pnpm changeset` to create a new changeset. You'll be prompted to:
1. Select which packages have changed
2. Choose a bump type (major/minor/patch)
3. Write a summary of the changes

### Versioning

Run `pnpm changeset:version` to consume all pending changesets, bump versions, and update changelogs.

### Publishing

Run `pnpm release` to build and publish all packages to npm.
